## Cursor control

The _3D cursor_ can be controlled with the mouse or arrow keys. The arrow keys move the _3D cursor_ along the XZ-plane by default, with **\[** and **\]** or the **scroll wheel** the _3D cursor_ moves along the remaining axis.

The **X**, **Y** or **Z** key locks the movement of the 3D cursor to that axis. **Shift + X**, **Y** or **Z** will lock the movement of the 3D cursor to the plane perpendicular to that axis.

**(** and **)** rotate the _3D cursor_ 90 degrees along the Y-axis.

## Camera control

Dragging the **MMB** rotates around the position of the 3D cursor. Combining the **MMB** with the **Ctrl** key zooms to and from the 3D cursor. **Shift** and the **MMB** pans in the view plane. Holding both **Ctrl** and **Shift** while dragging with the **MMB** changed the field of view.
